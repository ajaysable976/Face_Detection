# Real-time Gender Detection System
To create a gender detection system using Python, we need to train a model with some high-level features of the face of human beings such as:

- the distance between eyes, nose, and mouth 
- and measurements of different parts of the face of both the genders

# Prerequisite
- pip install opencv-python
- pip install cvlib

# working

# Summary
So this is how you can build a gender detection system by using the Python programming language. Gender detection is one of the popular computer vision applications.
When you use a camera to detect a personâ€™s gender instead of detecting it on a picture, it can be said to be a realtime gender detection system.
